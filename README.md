# How to Use LLaMA 3 Model in Kaggle for a Chat Interface

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using the LLaMA 3 model (70B version) for a chat interface in a Kaggle notebook. We will cover installing necessary dependencies, verifying file paths, loading the model, and creating a chat interface.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

First, we need to install the required libraries. This includes `transformers` for model handling and `torch` for tensor operations. Run the following command in a Kaggle notebook cell:

```python
!pip install transformers torch
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries
Next, we need to import the necessary libraries in our Python script. This includes importing the model and tokenizer classes from transformers and other essential libraries:
```
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch
import os

```

### Step 3: Set Up Model Path
Specify the path to your model files. Ensure that this path contains the necessary files like config.json, pytorch_model.bin, tokenizer_config.json, and tokenizer.json.


### Step 4: Load the Model and Tokenizer
Load the pre-trained LLaMA 3 model and tokenizer using the paths specified. Use the local_files_only=True parameter to ensure the files are loaded from the local directory without fetching from the Hugging Face Hub.
